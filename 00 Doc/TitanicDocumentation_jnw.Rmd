To retrieve the data from the database:
```{r}
source("../01 Data/TitanicData.R", echo = FALSE)
```

Print out a summary of the Titanic database:
```{r}
summary(df)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Titanic)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
